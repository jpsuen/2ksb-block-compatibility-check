# 2ksb-block-compatibility-check
This Chrome Extension was added to end the annoying "Compatibility Checks" that keep coming up on the 2KSB website.  The extension works by preventing the browser from loading the javascript page that contains the compatibility checker.

Additionally, after the Moodle theme upgrade in late June 2016 each page had a new floating "Student Support" Button.  This button is distracting and can also cover importnat information, especially when using zoom above 100%.  This extension removes the floating student support button on every page.
